Init is a Git wrapper for beginners.

It provides a simple command-line interface that guides users through common Git workflows
while explaining what each step does. Init is designed as a learning tool, not a replacement
for Git.

Init runs on top of Git and uses AI assistance to help users understand commands, errors,
and next actions.
